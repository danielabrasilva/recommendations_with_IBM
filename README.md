# Recommendations with IBM


### Project Motivation

This project was developed as one of the necessary requirements for approval on Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. In it, I created a notebook with functionalities aiming at an article recommendation system for users of the IBM Watson Platform.

The project is still under development and in the future the code will be combined into one class and moved to a web application.

### Project Descriptions

The project is divided in four parts:

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
 
 2. Rank-Based Recommendations
 
 3. User-User-Based Colaborative Filtering
 
 4. Content-Based Recommendations
 
 5. Matrix-Factorization
